JOURNAL ENTRY 1 : Our selected topic is a Basic Unit Converter. The problem it solves is that the majority of users wanting to convert units manually, like meters to centimeters, Celsius to Fahrenheit, or kilograms to grams struggle, doing these conversions mentally or on paper is a hassle and can lead to mistakes. This iis worth solving as it is a simple converter that can help in schoolwork, traveling, and many real-life situations. The target users are students, teachers, and anyone who needs quick and accurate unit conversions and to use it for simple, easy, fast results, and correct calculations.


JOURNAL ENTRY 2 : The key features of the Basic Unit Converter include converting length, weight, and temperature units. Our program allows the user to pick a category of their liking, choose a conversion type, and enter a value to convert.
The expected inputs are the value the user wants to convert and the type of conversion they select. The expected outputs are the converted value and a short description of the conversion result, it will show the results clearly so the user understands the conversion.


REFLECTION : We are most confident about the clarity and usefulness of the Basic Unit Converter project. It solves a common problem in school and daily life by providing fast unit conversions. We also feel confident about how I explained the inputs, outputs, and features of the program.
One thing we still want to improve is adding more units or making the design more advanced. But overall, we’re satisfied with the project and the proposal we created.
